    <h1>Leonardo da Vinci. Facts you probably never heard.</h1>
    
    <p>
        If you think you have heard enough about Da Vinci and can't be surprised anymore, you are most likely wrong unless, of course, you are his biggest fan and have learnt his biography by heart already. Leonardo da Vinci wasn't just an incredible artist, he was an inventor, scientist, mathematician, engineer, writer, musician and much more. He lived during the Renaissance, a cultural movement that led to important developments in areas such as art and science. Leonardo da Vinci is perhaps best known as a painter, with his legendary works including <i><b>Mona Lisa</b></i>, <i><b>Vitruvian Man</b></i> and <i><b>The Last Supper</b></i>, among others. However, his conceptual drawings included plans for musical instruments, war machines, calculators, boats and other ideas. Many of these plans were limited by the level of technology at the time.

    <h2>Well, let's be curious and dive deeper to find out something more interesting. You probably never knew that:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Da Vinci wrote in the opposite direction to what is normal, meaning you’d need a mirror to read it properly.</li> 
        <li>He became an expert in the anatomy of the human body, studying it in detail and creating hundreds of drawings to help explain his thoughts.</li>
        <li>Leonardo was a great procrasitinator. It could take him years to plan and improve his works.</li>
        <li>Many paintings and other works were abandoned or deemed incomplete, including one of his most famous projects, <i><b>Mona Lisa</b></i>. <i><b>La Gioconda</b></i>, by the by, is probably the most well-known masterpiece of Leonardo.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Have heard all of the mentioned before? Well, there are other, more mysterious facts about Leonardo. Let's see.</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>There are two years with no notice of Leonardo. Between 1476 and 1478, there is no single record about him. However, in 1478, when he again 'appeared on the radar', he claimed that he had been kidnapped by aliens and had been tested and tortured. Obviously, few people believe in that, however, right after 1478, Leonardo started scatching machines and constructions that he claimed he saw when was kidnapped. These scatches showed such machines that could not even be imagined at that time. People and the progress were too far before the times when the machines from his scatches could be at least prototyped. We might not believe that the master was indeed kidnapped by other creatures but 1476-1478 changed him a lot.  </li>
        <li>Leonardo's masterpieces have very clear and right giometry, there is always an axis, right geometrical forms, and angles. Just like his handwriting, his paintings often had to be mirrorred to see more. Hence, when you reflect <i><b>Mona Lisa</b></i> or <i><b>The Last Supper</b></i> along the axis, you will be shocked to see an allian-like man in a helmet. Did Leonardo indeed see them?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Right below, there are Leonardo's most famous masterpieces. Pretty sure you have seen them before but now pay attention to geometry, mystery, and signs of aliens if any.</h2>
